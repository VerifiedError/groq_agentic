# Deployment Automation & DevOps Infrastructure

## Objective
Automate deployment pipeline, implement CI/CD, improve infrastructure management, add monitoring and observability, and streamline development workflow.

## Background
Current deployment process:
- Manual push to GitHub → Vercel auto-deploy
- Manual database migrations
- No automated testing in CI
- No staging environment
- Limited monitoring and logging
